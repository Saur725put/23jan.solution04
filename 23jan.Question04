Q4
In C++, you can re-throw an exception using the "throw;" statement without any argument. This re-throws the current exception that is being handled.
try {
   
   if (some_error) {
      throw std::runtime_error("Error occurred");
   }
   
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
   
   log_error(e.what());
   throw;  
}
the try block contains code that may throw an exception, such as when the "some_error" condition is true. 
The catch block catches the exception and handles it by logging the error message. 
The throw statement without any argument is used to re-throw the exception, which can be caught by another catch block or passed up the call stack.
